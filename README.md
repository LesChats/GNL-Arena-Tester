## HOW TO USE IT

1. ```git clone https://github.com/LesChats/GNL-Arena-Tester.git```
  - you can clone this repo anywhere, by defaut in your own get_next_line directory...

2. ```cd GNL-Arena-Tester```

3. \(optional) ```vim** *bencher.sh```
  - if you need to change the default render directory (where your **get_next_line.c** is) juste edit **MY_GNL** variable
  
4. \(optional) 
- if you don't whant to compete VS my get_next_line (who's gonna blame ya ?) you cant put an other one in *GNL-Arena-Tester/validated-gnls/abaudot*
- *you can do somthinf like that :*
- ```rm -f *.c GNL-Arena-Tester/validated-gnls/abaudot && rm -f *.h GNL-Arena-Tester/validated-gnls/abaudot```
- ```cp -rf ../my_friend_get_next_line GNL-Arena-Tester/validated-gnls/abaudot```

5. ```./bencher.sh [x][y]```
  - where x is the BUFFER_SIZE (by default BUFFER_SIZE=42)
  - where y is the number of tests (by default y = 100)
  - be carfull the more y is big the more the bench is precise but it may take a lot of time...

## WHAT YOU GET ü§∫

- **Pride** üèåÔ∏è‚Äç or **disnonor** üí©  !
- fight spiriiiiiiiit ! ü§∫ ü§∫
- It can also help to test your get_next_line implementation because it output the biff bettwen my validated GNL and your canditate ;) 
- please send me a message or mail if you really beat me ;)

## HOW IT WORK ?

- firt the script generate multiples randome testing files (random lenght, content, news lines....)
- then it compare the output bettwen my GNL and yours.
- if the diff if not null the script will notify you, then can thind the diff result in diff.txt
- then it whill compare the two implementation in terme of user time (not cpu unfortunatly)
- the fastest **WIN !!**

## SIDE NOTES

- remember that this is a very naive way to compare the perfomence between implementation but it can give a strong clue about it.
- remember that all this is just for **FUN** and also for education, please feel free to look about my implementation.
